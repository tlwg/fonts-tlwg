thaifonts-scalable is a collection of Thai scalable fonts available
in free licenses. Its goal is to provide fonts that conform to
existing standards and recommendations, so that it can be a reference
implementation.

So, the fonts have to be modified from their original versions as
needed, according to following references:
  - Recommendation for Thai font design, from the National Font Project
  - Adobe Glyph naming convention
  - Microsoft Typography
  - Common practice for Thai Windows fonts

The tool used in this project is FontForge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/).
So, you need it in generating actual fonts. Automatic scripts for
building fonts with Makefile's are also provided, so that usual steps
still apply:
  $ ./configure [options]
  $ make
  # make install
You can choose target font formats to generate by applying --enable-*
options to the configure script. (Only TrueType is generated by default.)
And for each format, you can specify install directory using --with-*dir=
configure options. Please try `./configure --help' for the full list
of all available options.

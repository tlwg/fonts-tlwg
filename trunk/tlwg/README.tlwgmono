The motivation of creating TlwgMono font was from Mikachan font and SLThaiUI
font. When I tried Gentoo Linux and installed Japanese font, I didn't know
exactly what Japanese font I should install. I chose Mikachan font because
it is the Japanese font I found. It came out that this font is handwriting
font. I was impressed because the creator must write every Japanese (Chinese)
characters by hand. See here, http://mikachan-font.com/index2.html, she do
it this way. Comparing to Thai characters, Japanese is more more difficult.
If she can create Japanese font alone (at least writing every chatacters),
why can't I create Thai font. At the same time, Mr.Sirichai Lerdvorawut
showed his font, SLThaiUI, at TLWG-DEVEL mailing list. So I decided I
should create one which is needed. Here it is TlwgMono and I decided to
make the font monospace because we (Thai Linux community) don't have one.

TlwgMono's English characters are from Free UCS outline font. Why? Because
it is nice. I don't want to create another wheel. For Thai characters,
I imported thai18.pcf which is bitmap font from NECTEC as the background.
It is used as position reference. After drawed line by line many nights
after my work, it was done. Thanks to Pfaedit, the great font editing tool.

TlwgMono is GPL licensed, so it is free. I hope this font could be useful.
If you want to contribute, please take it and improve it. 

PS. I'm not the designer. Thanks to Thai Linux Working Group.
